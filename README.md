# 100DaysOfCode Challenge

Challenge created by the developer [Alexander Kallaway](https://twitter.com/ka11away). The goal is to code at least one hour every day. I decided to participate in the challenge so that programming becomes routine in my life. The rules are established [here](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code)

In my case, I will be doing the challenge following the site:
[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)

As I want to improve my knowledge in Python the developed projects will be posted here.

## Motivation:
<blockquote>In 2020 I had incredible experiences that showed me how rewarding it is to work with a purpose and thereby have a social impact. I understood that I need to study hard every day to reach the established goals and participate in new projects and I believe the #100DaysOfCode challenge will help me to improve my skills and become a better programmer!</blockquote>
